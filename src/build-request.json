      "id": "REQ-21",
      "text": "Add a subtle, early-2000s-style loading spinner that matches the existing vibrant pink theme and low-res/retro aesthetic, and show it briefly on initial app load within the 480p portal frame.",

          "Sure! You can do a subtle loading spinner, you can make it pink or something. Sorta like the early 2000’s atat one"

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On first page load, a small pink spinner is visible for a short, fixed duration (e.g., ~400–1200ms) and then disappears automatically.",
        "The spinner styling reads as early-2000s/retro (simple shape, slightly pixelated/low-res feel) and does not introduce a blue/purple color theme.",
        "The spinner is visually contained within the portal frame UI (not full-screen over the entire browser), and it does not shift layout when it appears/disappears.",
        "The spinner overlay does not block interaction longer than necessary; after it disappears, all existing UI elements behave as before.",
        "No backend changes are introduced."

  "constraints": [
    "Frontend immutable paths must not be edited: frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.ts, frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.tsx, frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts, frontend/src/main.tsx, and anything under frontend/src/components/ui.",
    "Keep the app as a single-page joke experience and preserve the existing pink + retro portal aesthetic."
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Implementing real network/request-based loading states for data fetching (the spinner may be purely cosmetic/initial-load only).",
    "Adding or changing backend canister state, methods, or schema."
