  "summary": "Most requested UI changes appear implemented: retro/low-res treatment utilities, animated per-letter header with underscores removed while keeping the tab title, randomized sidebar media via a new momMedia helper, and a rickroll handler. However, the global “Catull-style” typography requirement is likely not met (Catamaran is used, which is not Catull-like), and the provided “mom cooking/baking” video list appears to be mostly unrelated pop-music videos rather than mom-themed cooking/baking content.",

      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Update global typography so that all site text uses a Catull-style typeface (or a clearly similar free substitute), and update the main heading to use a more cartoonish display feel.",
      "reason": "The diff shows global fonts set to Catamaran (a modern sans) and Fredoka for display; there is no evidence of a Catull-style (inscriptional serif) font or a clearly similar substitute being used globally.",

      "requirement": "Embed mom-themed cooking/baking YouTube videos in sidebar UI boxes; randomized selections on different visits.",
      "reason": "While the code randomizes and provides YouTube IDs, the internal curated list shown is primarily mainstream music videos (e.g., Despacito, Uptown Funk, Roar, etc.) rather than mom-themed cooking/baking videos, so the content requirement is not evidenced as met.",

      "description": "Added faux early-2010s 'search bar' and action buttons (e.g., Upload) in the header UI.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on retro styling, fonts, header animation, sidebars for mom media, and a rickroll word. The diff shows additional header UI elements not explicitly requested.",
