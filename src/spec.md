# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the single-page joke site with an intentionally low-res early-2010s aesthetic, Catull-like typography, an animated main heading, randomized “mom media” sidebar content, and a rickroll easter egg.

**Planned changes:**
- Apply a subtle, consistent low-res/retro visual treatment across the page without reducing readability or breaking the existing pink theme, layout, banner, cards, or footer.
- Update global typography to a Catull-style font (or a legally usable free substitute) and make the main heading use a more cartoonish display style that still fits the early-2010s vibe.
- Change the on-page main header text to remove underscores (keep the browser tab title as “your_mom’s_website”) and animate each letter with a looping jump-and-squash effect without causing layout reflow.
- Add an early-2010s-style sidebar/side column (stacking on mobile) containing small UI boxes with embedded mom-themed cooking/baking YouTube videos, randomized per visit from an internal list.
- Add a matching sidebar section with small mom-article cards (title, snippet, source link), randomized per visit from an internal list, with links opening in a new tab using appropriate rel attributes.
- Add a rickroll easter egg by making a single clearly identifiable word clickable to redirect to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ.

**User-visible outcome:** The page looks more intentionally retro and low-res, uses Catull-like typography, shows an animated underscore-free heading, includes a randomized sidebar of mom videos and articles, and contains a clickable word that rickrolls the user.
