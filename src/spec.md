## Summary
**Goal:** Restyle the single-page joke homepage to a nostalgic early-2010s YouTube-like UI with a pink theme, a top photo banner, and an animated creme heading—while keeping the existing joke interaction intact.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the homepage layout/styling to resemble an early-2010s YouTube header/navigation and overall spacing/typography (single-page only).
- Add a full-width, wide-cropped banner image at the very top of the page using a 2010s-style stock photo of an excited mom giving a thumbs up.
- Restyle the main heading text (exactly `your_mom's_website`) to be creme-colored with a slow, looping gloss/sheen animation.
- Apply a global color theme: lighter vibrant pink background, darker pink UI surfaces, white default text; ensure the footer texts `moms_of_ momland.inc` and the joke copyright notes are not white.

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage looks like an early-2010s video-site UI in a pink palette, shows a top banner photo, features a creme glossy-animated title, and the punchline/next-joke interaction continues to work as before.
